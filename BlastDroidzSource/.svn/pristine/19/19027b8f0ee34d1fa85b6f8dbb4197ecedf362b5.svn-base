How to Play:

	Your objective is to blast as many droids as possible. You begin each session in a randomly
generated star system, complete with unique enemies, asteroid barricades, a jumpgate, and a
centralized star. Upon entering a system, you are prompted with a mission, which indicates how many
droids must be destroyed before unlocking the jumpgate. Once unlocked, all players within it's range
must activate it to move  on to the next system. Star systems increase in difficulty as players
progress by increasing enemy counts and mission costs. Blast Droids until your whole team is wiped out, 
and compare your scores from other sessions.

Controls:

	When playing with the mouse and keyboard, make sure that no xbox controllers are
plugged in. With this control scheme, only single player will be available. 
Controls are clearly stated in the tutorial and ship select menus. The mouse and keyboard 
controls use the WASD keys for movement, Left-click fires your "auto-attack" in the direction
of the cursor, and 'E' activates your special ability in the direction of the mouse if 
direction is required. 'F' zooms the camera and interacts with jumpgates. The keyboard keys required to
interact with the menus in Blast Droids! are showed in each menu. The keys almost all
correspond to the name of the desired menu. For example, 'O' will travel to the options
menu from the main menu. "Esc" will either go back from a menu, or exit the game from the
main menu.
	Blast Droids features up to 4-player cooperative play through the use of Xbox controllers.
The controls are simple, and are stated in the tutorial and ship select menus. Blast Droids uses
a twin-stick shooter control scheme, with left stick controlling movement and thrust, right stick 
controlling your primary fire and the aim, and finally, the 'A' button firing your ships
alternate ability in the direction of the right stick. The Left Bumper button interacts with the world, 
with functionality such as starting the traversal of a star system from the initial camera view,
and activating the jumpgate.

Cheat Codes:

	Players may press 'U' on the keyboard to skip to the next level. This is used to show
	off the level generation.
